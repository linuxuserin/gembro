## What's Gemini?

'You may think of Gemini as "the web, stripped right back to its essence" or as "Gopher, souped up and modernised just a little", depending upon your perspective (the latter view is probably more accurate).'

See [Project Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/)

```bash
go build
./gembro
```
